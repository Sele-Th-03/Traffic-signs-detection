# Traffic signs detection
Trained a custom YOLOv5 model that can detect various traffic signs and classify them into four categories: prohibitory, danger, mandatory,
and other. This model is versatile and can be utilized for analyzing images, videos, or even live camera streams. 
To test the code, download the dataset from ts https://www.kaggle.com/code/vimalpillai/traffic-signs-detection-using-yolov5-model/input. After downloading the dataset, please take the dataset.yml file and place it into the yolov5 folder that will be created by the main.ipynb code.
